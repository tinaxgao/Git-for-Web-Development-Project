Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        > block elements start on a new line. inline elements like <span> do not start on a new line.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        > it does not move when the window is resized.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        > use width: and min-width: together
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        > block by default: <p> <div> <li>
        inline by default: <img> <span> <a>
        inline-block by default: <input>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        > The box model is the way HTML tags wrap a conceptual box around content. Just like a box, the elements have properties like box width (border), packaging (padding), and spacing between boxes (margin).
        Conceptual boxes are stacked on or against each other in the window in a grid.
        I'm not sure what it means to "fix" the width in this question, but maybe you can force each element to inhabit its own line and set a width for the parent container or page.
